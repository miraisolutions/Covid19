# This script allows maintaining a reproducible way of tracking versions of
# package dependencies using renv, starting from all dependencies bound to a

# NOTE that renv would only enforce the given repo for the top-level
# dependencies, others seem to depend on what is found in the renv cache or was
# already installed => use remotes to get the full tree of dependencies with the
# version as in the specific repo.
# NOTE: the "recommended" CRAN packages (e.g. mgcv, nlme) are not covered by
# this process as they are normally kept bound to the version of R
renv::install("remotes")

# install the specific versions if not already installed
renv::install(with(deps, sprintf("%s@%s", package[diff!=0], available[diff!=0])))

# Set the CRAN repo and cherry-pick version-constrained updates
options(repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
renv::install("COVID19@3.0.2")
# Alternatively, set a newer MRAN date and update from there
# options(repos = "https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2020-10-12")
# renv::update("COVID19")

# Create the renv snapshot, making sure CRAN is set as repo, which will also end
# up in the lockfile. This allows restoring any version regardless of the
# corresponding MRAN date, since CRAN includes archives for older versions.
