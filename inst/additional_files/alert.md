### Update of 2020-03-26

[Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) is currently changing its data formats, making the current format [deprecated](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/1250). 

While we wait for the new format to be released, we are TEMPORARLY relying on the [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data) of [bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili), who is maintaining the old JHU CSSE data set format with updates declared as from [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). This is a new project and we cannot guarantee the reliability of the data source. We are, however, grateful to [bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data).

Stability, compatibility and reliability of data is one of the greatest challenges for data scientists, and in this time of turmoil COVID-19 data is in constant change. We are doing our best to keep up to date with the latest data.

Updates regarding data sources to be expected in the upcoming days, so stay tuned!
