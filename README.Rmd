The goal of Covid19Mirai is to provide an insight on coronavirus data taken from public and reliable resources.

## Data Source history

**Up to the 26th of March 2020**, the source was the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

However, due to a format change on the data source, we had to switch, **starting the 26th of March 2020**, to the [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data) of [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili), who is maintaining the old JHU CSSE data set format with updates declared as from [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). This is a new project and we cannot guarantee the long-term reliability of the data source. We are, however, grateful to [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data). 

**Update 4th of July 2020**, Data from few European countries have been readjusted recently, 
getting this update has given us the push to switch to a new and richer data source.
We have decided for the [COVID 19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/) project led
by [Emanuele Guidotti](https://guidotti.dev/) and [David Ardia](https://ardiad.github.io/). 
We are very thankful to [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his great
[work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data)

## The dashboard

It consists of 5 main pages:   

* **Global**: Summarizing top 5 countries in the world in each variable.   
* **Continents**: Summarizing world data per continent (defined according to UN), underneath sub-tabs with insight within continent:   
  + **Europe**: European data split by macro-areas with heat-maps per country.   
  + **Asia**: Asia data split by macro-areas with heat-maps per country.  
  + **Africa**: African data split by macro-areas with heat-maps per country.   
  + **Latin America & Carib.**: South and Central American with Caribbean Isles  by macro-areas with heat-maps per country.   
  + **Northern America**: Northern America (USA and Canada) data split by macro-areas with heat-maps per country.  
* **Switzerland**: Single country report of Switzerland.   
  + Maps and graphs of Cantonal data displayed.
* **Country**: Single country report.   
  + If available regional graphs and data will be displayed.
* **Country Comparison**: Comparison report between N countries from all over the world. 

Macro areas of Continents are defined following United Nations indications.

Data are updated with a delay of 40h, i.e. at 4pm the Last date is updated taking the yesterday date. This allows having data for about all countries when the date is updated with the new one.

## The Variables

The Covid19datahub project can allow us to use the following variables:  

* _confirmed_: number of confirmed cases. Usually tested positive.  
* _recovered_: number of healed or tested negative cases. Some countries have stopped reporting recovered cases.   
* _deaths_: number of dead confirmed cases.   
* _tests_: number of tests. Not available for all countries.    
* _hosp_: number of currently hospitalised confirmed cases. Not available for all countries.  
* _icuvent_: number of currently hospitalised Ventilated or in Intensive Care. Not available for all countries. Categorization differed from countries to country therefore Ventilated and Intensive Care variables have been aggregated.
* _stringency index_: Lock Down stringency index from 0 to 100.  
* _vaccines_: number of vaccined people.   
* _population_: population size.  

The following variables are computed by the application:   

* _active_: number of active cases, usually tested positive. _confirmed_ - _recovered_ - _deaths_.   
* _prevalence over 1M_: number of confirmed cases per 1 Million inhabitants.  
* _growth factors (3 7 14)_: number of confirmed cases today divided by the number of confirmed cases 3 7 14 days ago over the previous 2 months.
* _lethality rate_: number of _deaths_ divided by the number of _confirmed_ cases.   
* _mortality rate_: number of _deaths_ divided by the _population_ size.   
* _positive test rate_: number of positive tests, i.e. _confirmed_ divided by the _tests_ carried in the day.   
* _int care hospitalised rate_: number of patients currently in Intensive Care / Ventilated status, divided by the number of currently _hospitalised_ patients.   
* _vaccines rate_: number of _vaccines_ divided by the _population_ size.   
* _new (variable)_: all variables labeled "new" are the delta of day X value - day X-1.  
* _last week (variable)_: all variables labeled "last week" are the totals of the last 7 days.  
* _last month (variable)_: all variables labeled "last month" are the totals of the last 30 days. 

The results are visualized as a shiny app.
