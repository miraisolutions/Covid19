# Covid19

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R build status](https://github.com/miraisolutions/Covid19/workflows/CI-CD/badge.svg)](https://github.com/miraisolutions/Covid19/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Covid19 is to fetch coronavirus data from public and reliable resources available and analyze them.

**Up to the 26th of March 2020**, the source was the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

However, due to a format change on the data source, we had to swich, **starting the 26th of March 2020**, to the [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data) of [bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili), who is maintaining the old JHU CSSE data set format with updates declared as from [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). This is a new project and we cannot guarantee the long-term reliability of the data source. We are, however, grateful to [bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data). 

The results are visualized as a shiny app.
