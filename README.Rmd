The goal of Covid19Mirai is to provide an insight on coronavirus data taken from public and reliable resources.

## Data Source history

**Up to the 26th of March 2020**, the source was the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

However, due to a format change on the data source, we had to switch, **starting the 26th of March 2020**, to the [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data) of [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili), who is maintaining the old JHU CSSE data set format with updates declared as from [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). This is a new project and we cannot guarantee the long-term reliability of the data source. We are, however, grateful to [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data). 

**Update XX of June 2020**, Data from few European countries have been readjusted recently, 
getting this update has given us the push to switch to a new and richer data source.
We have decided for the [COVID 19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/) project led
by [Emanuele Guidotti](https://guidotti.dev/) and [David Ardia](https://ardiad.github.io/). 
We are very thankful to [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his great
[work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data)

## The dashboard

It consists of 4 main pages:   

* **Global**: Summarizing top 5 countries in the world in each variable.   
* **Continents**: Summarizing world data per continent (defined according to UN), underneath subtabs with insight within continent:   
  + **Europe**: European data split by macroareas with heatmaps per country.   
  + **Asia**: Asia data split by macroareas with heatmaps per country.  
  + **Africa**: African data split by macroareas with heatmaps per country.   
  + **Latin America & Carib.**: South and Central American with Caribbean Isles  by macroareas with heatmaps per country.   
  + **Northern America**: Northern America (USA and Canada) data split by macroareas with heatmaps per country.   
* **Country**: Single country report.   
* **Country Comparison**: Comparison report between N countries from all over the world.  

## The Variables

The Covid19datahub project can allow us to use the following variables:  

* _confirmed_: number of confirmed cases. Usually tested positive.  
* _recovered_: number of healed or tested negative cases. Some countries have stopped reporting recovered cases.   
* _deaths_: number of dead confirmed cases.   
* _tests_: number of tests. Not available for all countries.    
* _hosp_: number of hospitalised confirmed cases. Not available for all countries.  
* _population_: population size.  

The following variables are computed by the application:   

* _active_: number of active cases, usually tested positive. _confirmed_ - _recovered_ - _deaths_.   
* _prevalence over 1M_: number of confirmed cases per 1 Million inhabitants.  
* _growth factors (3 5 7)_: number of confirmed cases today divided by the number of confirmed cases 3 5 7 days ago.   
* _lethality rate_: number of _deaths_ divided by the number of _confirmed_ cases.   
* _mortality rate_: number of _deaths_ divided by the _population_ size.   

The results are visualized as a shiny app.

## Installation

You can install Covid19Mirai from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
