The goal of Covid19Mirai is to fetch coronavirus data from public and reliable resources available and analyze them.

## Data Source history

**Up to the 26th of March 2020**, the source was the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

However, due to a format change on the data source, we had to swich, **starting the 26th of March 2020**, to the [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data) of [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili), who is maintaining the old JHU CSSE data set format with updates declared as from [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). This is a new project and we cannot guarantee the long-term reliability of the data source. We are, however, grateful to [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his [work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data). 

**Update XX of June 2020**, Data from few European countries have been readjusted recently, 
getting this update has given us the push to switch to a new and richer data source.
We have decided for the [COVID 19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/) project lead
by [Emanuele Guidotti](https://guidotti.dev/) and [David Ardia](https://ardiad.github.io/). 
We are very thankful to [David Bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili) for his great
[work](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data)

The results are visualized as a shiny app.
